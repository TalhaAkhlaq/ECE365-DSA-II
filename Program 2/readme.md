# Program 2: Priority Queue Using Binary Heap

## Description

This program implements a priority queue using a binary heap to manage tasks or elements based on priority, with support for insertion, deletion, and key adjustments.

## Files

- **Hash.cpp and Hash.h**: Implements the hash table with insertion, lookup, and rehashing.
- **useHeap.cpp**: Tests the heap implementation.

## Functionality
1. Manages elements with unique string IDs, keys, and optional data pointers.
2. Provides operations to insert elements, remove the minimum, adjust keys, and delete elements by ID.
3. Uses the hash table from Program 1 to map IDs to heap nodes for efficient operations.
