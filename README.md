# Data Structures & Algorithms II

This repository contains programming assignments and projects developed as part of Data Structures & Algorithms II (ECE 365), offered in Fall 2024. The course builds upon foundational concepts from ECE 264, focusing on graph algorithms, dynamic programming, turing machines, computability, and NP-completeness.

## Project Description and Overview

This repository includes three C++ programs developed for the course:

1. **Program 1**: Develop a hash table to implement a spell checker that efficiently processes large dictionaries and documents.
2. **Program 2**: Implements a binary heap-based priority queue with operations for insertion, delete-min, key adjustment, and removal.
3. **Program 3**: Solves the single-source shortest-path problem using Dijkstra's algorithm with a binary heap for efficient graph pathfinding.
4. **Program 4**: Implements a solution to a dynamic programming challenge, demonstrating optimization techniques.
