# Data Structures & Algorithms II

This repository contains programming assignments and projects developed as part of Data Structures & Algorithms II (ECE 365), offered in Fall 2024. The course builds upon foundational concepts from ECE 264, focusing on graph algorithms, dynamic programming, turing machines, computability, and NP-completeness.

## Project Description and Overview

This repository includes three C++ programs developed for the course:

1. **Program 1**: A spell checker that uses a custom hash table to handle large dictionaries and identify unrecognized words in documents.
2. **Program 2**: A priority queue built with a binary heap that manages tasks or elements based on priority, supporting insertion, deletion, and priority updates.
3. **Program 3**: A graph algorithm that calculates the shortest paths from a starting vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm and a binary heap.
4. **Program 4**: A dynamic programming solution designed to solve complex optimization problems through recursive techniques.
