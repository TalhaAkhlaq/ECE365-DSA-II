# Program 4: Dynamic Programming

## Description

This program solves a complex optimization problem using dynamic programming techniques to break the problem into smaller subproblems and build an optimal solution.

## Files

- **dynamic.cpp**: Implements the dynamic programming algorithm and handles input/output.

## Functionality
1. Reads problem-specific input and processes constraints to set up the solution space.
2. Uses dynamic programming to compute results efficiently and optimally.
3. Outputs the solution in the required format.
